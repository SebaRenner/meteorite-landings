# meteorite-landings

### Project Description ###
The given data set from NASA provides us with information about the meteorites name, its classification, its mass, its touch-down coordinates, the year of the incident and if it was recorded falling or found later in the ground. We think about using the geolocation data to visualize where the meteorites hit the earth on a world map. Also, we think about using the mass of the meteorites to determine the size of the mark on the map. The year metric allows us to create a timeline to give an overview of meteor strikes over time.
